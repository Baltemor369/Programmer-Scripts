# Script Batch

A repository to push some useful scripts for git, python or java projects.

## Issues

If you can't run scripts, run a powershell as admin and enter this : 

```
Get-ExecutionPolicy
```
If you have "Restricted", you have to change it into another state like "RemoteSigned" :

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

## Features

All script have a -help to explain you the command if arguments can be asked.
You can launch a script with the CMD or the folder explorer, arguments will always be requested if necssary.
